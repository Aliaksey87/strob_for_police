I sketched the firmware for the "flasher" like that of the special services.
The circuit is simple, each LED is connected to the arduino board through a resistor.
A total of 10 LED blinking programs. The same number of LEDs.
If the board is de-energized, the next time the board is turned on, the board will start in the last selected mode.

If anyone wants to repeat:
